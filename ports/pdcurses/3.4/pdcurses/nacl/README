PDCurses for Native Client
==========================

This directory contains PDCurses source code files specific to Native Client


Building
--------

. Choose the appropriate makefile for your compiler:

        Makefile        = x86_32

. Optionally, you can build in a different directory than the platform
  directory by setting PDCURSES_SRCDIR to point to the directory where
  you unpacked PDCurses, and changing to your target directory:

	set PDCURSES_SRCDIR=/your_dir/pdcurses

. Build it:

	make -f makefilename

  You can also give the optional parameter "WIDE=Y", to build the 
  library with wide-character (Unicode) support:

	make -f mingwin32.mak WIDE=Y

  When built this way, the library is not compatible with Windows 9x,
  unless you also link with the Microsoft Layer for Unicode (not
  tested).

  Another option, "UTF8=Y", makes PDCurses ignore the system locale, and 
  treat all narrow-character strings as UTF-8. This option has no effect 
  unless WIDE=Y is also set. Use it to get around the poor support for 
  UTF-8 in the Win32 console:

	make -f mingwin32.mak WIDE=Y UTF8=Y
